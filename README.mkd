# cabal-ghc-dynflags â€” GHC API for Cabal packges 

This package is intended for use by developers of
[Haskell](http://www.haskell.org) tooling built against the
[GHC](http://ghc.haskell.org/) API. One major hurtle when using the API is
configuring GHC's dynamic flags (`DynFlags`), especially when running against
code usually built by `Cabal`.

This library handles `DynFlags` configuration, using the `Cabal` library to
determine how Cabal would have invoked GHC and configuring `DynFlags`
appropriately.

See the Haddock documentation in `GHC.Cabal` for details.

Note that it is still necessary to run `cabal build` in a Cabal project tree
before `cagal-ghc-dynflags` will be able to successfully run.
